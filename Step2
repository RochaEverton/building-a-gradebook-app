/*Now the teacher needs your help converting the student score to a letter grade.

Complete the getGrade function that takes a number score as a parameter. Your function should return a string representing a letter grade based on the score.

Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:
Score Range 	Grade
100 	"A++"
90 - 99 	"A"
80 - 89 	"B"
70 - 79 	"C"
60 - 69 	"D"
0 - 59 	"F"

Tips

    Remember that you learned about conditional statements (if, else if, and else).
    Remember that you learned about comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ===).
    Remember that you learned about the logical AND operator (&&).

function getGrade(score) {
 if(score <= 59){ return "F"}
 else if (score <= 69){ return "D"}
 else if (score <= 79){ return "C"}
 else if (score <= 89){ return "B"}
 else if (score <= 99){ return "A"}
 else if (score == 100){ return "A++"}
}

console.log(getGrade(96));
console.log(getGrade(82));
console.log(getGrade(56));
